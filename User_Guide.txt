- Extracts key details: Invoice Number, Date, Amount, Vendor.
- Saves extracted data to:
  - Excel file (`invoices.xlsx`)
  - SQLite database (`invoices.db`)
- Simple GUI using Tkinter for user interaction.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Launch the App
- Run the main GUI script:
```bash
python app_gui.py
```

### Step 2: Download and Process Invoices
- Click the **"Download Invoices from Email"** button.
- The app will:
  1. Connect to your email.
  2. Download emails with PDF attachments containing the word "invoice".
  3. Extract invoice data from those PDFs.
  4. Save data to Excel and SQLite.

### Step 3: View Saved Data

## Folder Structure
